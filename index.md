## Course Description

Statistical methods of spatial data analysis, stationary and nonstationary random fields, covariance structures, geostatistical models and analysis, spatial point process models and analysis, spatial lattice models and analysis.

## Learning Outcomes:
At the end of the course students will be able to:

1. Create maps and other data visualization products with spatial data,

2. Identify differences between the three common spatial data types: point process, point-referenced, and areal data.

3. Use statistical software and either Bayesian or classical statistical techniques to analyze spatial point process, geostatistical, and areal data structures.

4. Implement version control tools, such as git and github, on spatial data analyses.

## Prerequisites

- Required: STAT 412, STAT 512, and STAT 422
- Preferred: STAT 506, extensive experience with R, and an understanding or interest in Bayesian statistics

## Textbooks

- Hierarchical Modeling and Analysis for Spatial Data, Second Edition, by Bannerjee, Carlin, and Gelfand. While the second edition is preferred, the first edition will suffice.

- [Geocomputation with R: mapping overview](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/adv-map.html)(*optional*) is a freely available book that provides good context on spatial data structure and visualization in R.

## Additional Resources
Analysis, data visualization, and version control procedures will be implemented with:

- R / R Studio
- Git / Github

## Course Policies


#### Grading Policy

- **15%** of your grade will be determined by weekly quizzes to be completed prior to class on Tuesdays.

- **35%** of your grade will be determined by weekly homework assignments. Collaboration is encouraged on homework assignments, but everyone should complete their own assignments.

- **25%** of your grade will be determined by a midterm project that focuses on point-referenced data. The midterm project will have a written component and an oral presentation and will likely be due the week prior to spring break.

- **25%** of your grade will be determined by a final project that focuses on either areal data or point process data. The final project will have a written component and an oral presentation and will due the finals week.


#### Collaboration
University policy states that, unless otherwise specified, students may not collaborate on graded material. Any exceptions to this policy will be stated explicitly for individual assignments. If you have any questions about the limits of collaboration, you are expected to ask for clarification.

In this class students are encouraged to collaborate on homework assignments, but quizzes should be completed without collaboration.


####  Academic Misconduct
Section 420 of the Student Conduct Code describes academic misconduct as including but not limited to plagiarism, cheating, multiple submissions, or facilitating others' misconduct. Possible sanctions for academic misconduct range from an oral reprimand to expulsion from the university.

#### Disabilities Policy

Federal law mandates the provision of services at the university-level to qualified students with disabilities. Make sure to include all that relevant information here.
